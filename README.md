This project focuses on predicting customer purchases based on demographic and behavioral data using a Decision Tree classifier. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, income, browsing history, and previous purchases. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically Decision Trees, we aim to build a predictive model that can help businesses understand which customers are more likely to make a purchase.
